# Vite + React + Typescript + Eslint + Prettier

A starter for React with Typescript with the fast Vite and all static code testing with Eslint and formatting with Prettier.

I found out about Vite and I wanted to have a boilerplate for the technologies that I use. You can find more about these in the following links: [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `yarn install`

## Start

After the successfull installation of the packages: `yarn start`
